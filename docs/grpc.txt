gRPC Documentation
==================

Location data definition:

message LocationMessage {
    int32 person_id = 1;
    string latitude = 2;
    string longitude = 3;
}

Example:

{
    person_id=1,
    latitude=48.113704,
    longitude=11.637020
}



The gRPC server is hosted on the location-ingestor microservice on port 5005. 
One can use writer.py in the microservice to illustrate sending location data to the server.

To test, run these:

kubectl exec -it $LOCATION_INGESTOR_POD sh


The above command is to enter the location-ingestor pod. You can also use Lens to enter Pod Shell.
Once inside the pod, you can run the following command:


python writer.py
